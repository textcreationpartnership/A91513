            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Abſtract OF A LETTER From a Perſon of Eminency and worth in <hi>Caledonia</hi> to a Friend at <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have Received your kind Letter of the 26 <hi>December</hi> laſt, and Communicated it to the Gentlemen of the Council here; to whom your kind Sentiments, and Readineſs were very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
            <p>Certainly the Work here begun is the moſt Ripened, Digeſted, and the beſt Founded, as to Priviledges, Place, Time, and other like Advantages, that ever was yet begun in any part of the Trading World. We Arrived upon this Coaſt the firſt, and took poſſeſſion the third of <hi>November:</hi> Our Scituation is about Two Leagues to the Southward of <hi>Golden-Iſland,</hi> (by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called <hi>Guarda</hi>) in one of the beſt &amp; moſt defenceable Harbours perhaps in the World. The Country is Healthful to a wonder; inſomuch that our own Sick, which were many when we Arrived, are now generally cured. The Country is exceeding Fertile, and the Weather Temperate: The Country where we are Settled, is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171465:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 3 -->dry, and riſing ground, Hills but not High; and on the ſides, and quite to the tops, three, four or five foot good fat mould, not a Rock or Stone to be ſeen. We have but Eight or Nine Leagues to a River, where Boats may go into the South Sea. The Natives for Fifty Leagues on either ſide are in intire friendſhip and Correſpondence with us; and if we will be at the pains, we can gain thoſe at the greateſt diſtance. For our Neighbour <hi>Indians</hi> are willing to be the joyful Meſſengers of our Settlement, and good diſpoſition to their Country-men. As to the Innate Riches of the Countrey, upon the firſt information, I always believed to be very great: but now find it goes beyond all that ever I thought, or conceited in that matter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as we can underſtand, are very much ſurprized, and alarm'd, and the more that it comes as a Thunder-clap upon them; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had no notice of us, until three days after our Arrival. We have Written to the Praeſident of <hi>Panama,</hi> giving him Account of our good and peaceable intentions, and to procure a good Underſtanding and Correſpondence; And if that is not condeſcended to; we are ready for what elſe he pleaſes. If Merchants ſhould once Erect Factories here, this place will ſoon become the beſt and ſureſt Mart in all <hi>America,</hi> both for In-land and Over-land Trade. We want here Sloops and Coaſting Veſſels; for want of which, and by reaſon we have been all hands at work in fortifying and fitting our ſelves (which is now pretty well over) we have had but little Trade as yet: moſt of our Goods Unſold. We are here a Thouſand one hundred Men, and expect Supplies every day. We have been exceeding unhappy in looſing two Miniſters who came with us from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and if <hi>New England</hi> could ſupply us in that, it would be a great and laſting Obligation.</p>
